  Use the icon shortcode to quickly add a Font Awesome icon to your content. You
  can also use fa for regular icons, fab for brand icons, and fas for solid
  icons.

      Icon to include. You can use shorthand notation such as `fas sort` to
      include a Font Awesome icon. The argument also supports files with an
      `.svg` extension. Inline type definition overrides global for position support.

      of using the icon name.

      Modifier classes for styling and animation (e.g., `fa-2x`, `fa-spin`,
      `fa-beat`). Reintroduced in v2.0.0 after being deprecated in v1.0.0.
      Previously used for full icon specification (family, name, styling); now
      exclusively for modifier classes. When using family-specific shortcodes
      with positional arguments, all arguments after the icon name are joined
      as modifier classes.

      Deprecated. This parameter is no longer used by the icon rendering engine.
